Owshen is a privacy platform built for EVM-based blockchains. Owshen gathers multiple ideas around cryptocurrency privacy solutions in a single place to provide ultimate privacy.

Using Owshen you can get a **_fixed_** Owshen address and start transacting with users inside/outside of the platform, without exposing:

1. **Source** (Spend your coins using Zcash/TornadoCash-style merkle inclusion proofs, along with nullifiers)
2. **Destination** (Monero-style stealth-addresses are generated each time you send your coins to someone)
3. **Token/Amount** (These values are obfuscated and only the sender and receiver, who know a shared-secret, will be able to decode them)
